            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe happy Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> having long ſince filled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner of the Three Kingdoms with Joy and Gladneſs, and e're this reacht the Ears of all <hi>Europe;</hi> The Kings Majeſty to Commemorate the ſame and the Queens Majeſties Up-fitting, in his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generoſity, Commanded the moſt Accompliſhtly Ingenious Sir <hi>Martin Beckman,</hi> His Ingeneer at the <hi>Tower,</hi> forthwith for to prepare ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines and Fireworks, as might be ſuitable to ſo great an Occaſion, and to prepare them for His and the Queens Royal view on the <hi>Thames</hi> before His Palace of <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Obedience thereto Sir <hi>Martin</hi> prepared large Veſſels, called Lighters, which being cloſe covered or Scaffolded, thereon erected as many different Figures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Betwixt two ſquare Pyramids in an Iron Chain hung in the Centre a <hi>Sun</hi> in its Glory; below that, in a direct Line an <hi>Imperial Crown;</hi> and under that, <hi>J.

            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> A <hi>Bacchus</hi> bigger than the Life (with all parts full of Holes ſtopt with Fire-works) aſtride on a large Tun covered as the two Pyramids with Tun-plates, and alſo many ſorts of Fire-works on every quarter.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth,</hi> Were planted full of Morter-pieces of different ſizes for throwing of Bombs, Carcaſſes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whoſe Shells were made of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis and laſht about with Cords, and ſo contrived to break when falling, to prevent the leaſt miſchief where they fell.</p>

               <hi>Seventh</hi> and <hi>Eight,</hi> Planted with ſmall Chambers and other ſmall Pieces erect, and very thick one by another.</p>
            <p n="9">9th. 0 11 and 12th. Were furniſhed with Sky-Rockets and many other Curioſities for ſpringing up a vaſt height in the Air in divers Figures, and done with that extraordinary Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhewed the greatneſs of the Deſigner, each having private receptacles for Fire-works to ſupply as the others burnt off.</p>

            <p>About 40 great pieces of Piles were drove in at a competent diſtance one from another, and whole pieces of Firr Timber faſtned from Pile to Pile made a Line Round them, and kept all Boats coming in to avoid confuſion and accidents which attend ſuch mighty confluences of People.</p>
            <p>Thus every thing being prepared, and the Men poſted in their proper ſtations, the ſeveral Water Pageants were placed in a Line before <hi>White-Hall,</hi> thoſe with the Pyramids and Figures in the Centre.</p>
            <p>About Nine at Night the Engineers began, and firſt fired the Sun, the Imperial Crown, the Cypher of the King and Queens Names, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which Compoſed the ſeveral Mottos, with other ornamental things about the Figures and Pyramids; all which was compoſed of Iron Work with Wire, which when on Fire was curious, and ſeemed as flaming Iron for a long time glowing, the Sun in the like manner appeared as glorious as at noon-day, and the Crown as a body of Fire ſo formed, which while the numerous Spectators with admiration beheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were ſurpriſed with Fire-works in the Water betwixt the King and the Lighters, and thouſands of Rockets flying up in the Ayre a prodigious height, beginning and ending in different Figures, and ſuch continued Firings like great Guns, as it in ſome meaſure, for Fire, Smoke, and Noiſe, repreſented a Sea Fight. Thus were their Majeſties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for more than an hour diverted even to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as delight, which was concluded with the continued Shouts and Huzzas of the People, and the great Guns at the Tower; of all which no doubt a large Account will be given to the World.</p>
